## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Schema Additions
```sql
CREATE TABLE Achievement (
    AchievementID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Description VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    Icon VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'trophy',
    RequirementType ENUM('QUESTIONS_ANSWERED', 'CORRECT_ANSWERS', 'GAMES_PLAYED', 'MULTIPLAYER_WINS', 'STREAK', 'CATEGORY_MASTER') NOT NULL,
    RequirementValue INT NOT NULL,
    RequirementCategory VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT NULL,
    Points INT DEFAULT 10,
    CreatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE PlayerAchievement (
    PlayerAchievementID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
